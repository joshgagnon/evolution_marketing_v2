                                We recommend serving a bankruptcy notice if the individual debtor does not pay the debt in accordance with the Court order. Our fee includes:

                                On the date allocated for the first call of the creditor’s application, we recommend seeking an order for adjudication. Our fee includes:

                                <li>Sealing order for adjudication.</li>
                            </ul>

                                At this point, the Official Assignee will be responsible for repaying the individual’s debt out of the assets available in his or her estate, to the extent those assets are able to repay the debt. The creditor will submit a proof of debt in the bankruptcy when prompted by the Official Assignee. No further recovery action may be taken against the individual.

                    <p>We have limited our fixed fee debt recovery services to debts worth more than $15,000 because debts up to that amount, and up to $20,000 if all parties agree, are within the jurisdiction of the <a href="https://disputestribunal.govt.nz/">Disputes Tribunal</a>. Parties to hearings in the Disputes Tribunal usually represent themselves, as lawyers cannot represent them.</p>
